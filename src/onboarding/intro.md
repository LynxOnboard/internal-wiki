# Onboarding

This section helps new team members get productive quickly.

You are not expected to understand the entire system on day one.
Focus on:
- Getting the app running locally
- Understanding how your work fits into the system
- Asking questions early

## Key principles
- Small, incremental changes
- Clear communication
- Prefer correctness over cleverness

Start with **Local Setup**, then read **Team Norms**.
