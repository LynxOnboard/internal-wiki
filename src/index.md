# Welcome

Welcome to the Lynx project documentation.

This site exists to:
- Help new team members onboard quickly
- Document system architecture and decisions
- Define how we build, review, and ship software

## What this project is
Lynx is a product focused on delivering a reliable, scalable club management and scheduling platform with web and mobile clients.

## What this documentation is (and is not)
**This is:**
- A shared source of truth
- A guide for how we work
- A record of important decisions

**This is not:**
- A place for secrets or credentials
- A substitute for reading the code
- A marketing document

If something here is unclear or outdated, fix it.
